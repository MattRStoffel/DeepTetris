The data in resources is from other people.

Tom7 is where i learned about FCEUX and inspired this project in a sense. Applying Artificial Intelligence to Nintendo Tetris is the AI that one of the training sets is based on. Using this data is possibly an issue because the code is deterministic. That is bad news and good news, we cannot overfit the model because the data from this is deterministic and plays a prefect game of Tetris. But that is also bad because if we do overfit it will by definition be deterministic ruining the point of training a model. It will just memorise the training data.
